## 📌 Introduction

The **Campus Facility Management System** is developed by a dedicated team led by **N. Niveditha (Team Lead)**, along with members **B. Aravind Kumar**, **P. Mohammad Mansoor**, and **P. Nireesha**.

- Submit complaints about maintenance or infrastructure issues  
- Track the complaint status until resolution  

This project focuses on improving campus life by providing a transparent, efficient complaint management system.
